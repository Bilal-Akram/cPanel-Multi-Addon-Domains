To use the script:

For the latest instructions and script versions go here: http://www.spotonseoservices.com/free-cpanel-php-script-automate-creation-addon-domains/

Your host should support PHP 4 or later versions or PHP.

Add your domain list to domains.txt (included in download).  I would recommend not doing more than 50-100 domains at a time.  I recently added 105 domains to one HostGator account with no problems.  Start small, maybe only try adding the first three to ensure everything is working correctly.

To use the script, create a folder off of one of your sites hosted on the same cPanel account.  

Then upload addonhelper.php, domains.txt, index.php, style.css to that folder.

***To locate your cPanel skin name look at red text, http://mysite.com:2082/frontend/x3/index.php
In this case the cPanel screen name would be x3.  If you have trouble locating your skin name you may need to contact your host.
